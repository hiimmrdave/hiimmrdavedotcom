I've worked in animal health for over a decade. I've done it for long enough that I've gotten some ideas about how it works. In fact, I've worked with customers and been on teams long enough that I've gotten some ideas about how they work, too. I am working with more and more people, as you do, who are less experienced than me, and also more people who are younger than me. I'm discovering in myself a real passion for sharing the knowledge and experience I've developed. In fact, it's become a major focus of mine. I'd love to talk about doing more of the latter.
