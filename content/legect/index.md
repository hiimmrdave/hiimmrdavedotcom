I'm mostly curious how the whole footnotes^[This is the part that gets added below] thing goes.

If I write additional[^extra] notes in a separate paragraph then I can [^1] reference them below. What happens if I don't respect the auto-numbering?

If I go on to add additional footnotes, what happens then?[^1]

Areas of interest:

- Check out the starting flow chart for [dose-calc](dose-calc/)
- New ideas go to [inbox](inbox)

[^extra]: this footnote is a bit extra
[^1]: This is the first footnote I numbered.
