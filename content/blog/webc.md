## Behold

A man!

<small>that's a joke about Diogenes</small>

This one post is using the webc-based layout chain. The goal is to create feature parity with the other pages on the site, then gradually pull out the nunjucks.

<postlist></postlist>

## TODO

- <del>make that list be in correct order</del>
- props for how many history posts, from specific tags, other features?
- navigation
- date formats
- how tags work
