I started my journey to learn web development in early 2018. I've played with
python, but I've been using mainly javascript and node.js since late 2019. The
web has always excited me, with its quick feedback loops and multitude of 
interfaces and availability. Done right, the web can offer each person the the
best experience for them. We often fall short of that potential. It's easy to
cut corners, to say we'll fix it later, and leave people out. We have to do
better.

I'm here to do better.
